		    <b>Sierpinski Triangle</b>
		    <br/><i>Shape colors are generated based on a hash of the shape's position and size, added to the frameCount,<br/>then plugged into different sine/cosine functions to generate a yellow/blue color gradient.</i>
		    <br/>Press <b>W</b> to increase the number of iterations that are used to generate the fractal. <br/><b>S</b> will decrease the number of iterations.
		    <br/>Press <b>up arrow</b> to increase the number of sides of each polygon. This also increases the number that spawn at each iteration.<br/><b>down arrow</b> will decrease both of these variables.
		    <br/>Press <b>A</b> to spread apart the shapes. This is EXTREMELY important for the square fractal, otherwise it will just form a large square!<br/><b>D</b> will attract the shapes.
		    <br/><b>Mandelbrot Set</b>
		    <br/>Press <b>T</b> to increase the resolution of the image. Higher resolution images will take exponentially longer to render.<br/><b>G</b> decreases the resolution.
		    <br/>Press <b>WASD</b> to move the fractal around the screen.
		    <br/>Press <b>up arrow</b> to zoom in and <b>down arrow</b> to zoom out.
		    <br/>Press <b>right arrow</b> to increase the number of iterations used to generate the fractal. (Makes it more intricate)<br/><b>left arrow</b> will decrease the number of iterations.
